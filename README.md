# GeoQuery

A simple proof-of-concept tool to run geographic queries via a simple click-and-drag UI.  Built at [2015 Hacking Journalism](http://hackingjournalism.com/) hackathon.

Uses the [leaflet draw plugin](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.draw) to draw the query circle.  For this demonstration, queries are run against Google's [YouTube Data API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/), and video results are rendered using [Embedly Cards](http://embed.ly/cards).
